            <p id="para">Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the paragraph will be about
                epidemiological evidence, but only the second version establishes an argumentative point and puts it in
                context. The paragraph doesn’t just describe the epidemiological evidence; it shows how epidemiology is
                telling the same story as etiology. Similarly, while Version A doesn’t relate to anything in particular,
                Version B immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological pathway (i.e. etiology)
                of a disease and that the new paragraph will bolster the emerging hypothesis with a different kind of
                evidence. As a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph about cells and chemicals and such
                relates to the paragraph about populations in different places.

                A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of
                the paragraph. (The first sentence this paragraph is a good example of this in action!) This placement
                helps readers comprehend your argument. To see how, try this: find an academic piece (such as a textbook
                or scholarly article) that strikes you as well written and go through part of it reading just the first
                sentence of each paragraph. You should be able to easily follow the sequence of logic. When you’re
                writing for professors, it is especially effective to put your key sentences first because they usually
                convey your own original thinking. It’s a very good sign when your paragraphs are typically composed of
                a telling key sentence followed by evidence and explanation.

                Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively. When
                you’re reading a complicated academic piece for the first time, you might want to go through reading
                only the first sentence or two of each paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument. Then you
                can go back and read all of it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit in. And when you’re
                writing, you may also find it useful to write the first sentence of each paragraph (instead of a
                topic-based outline) to map out a thorough argument before getting immersed in sentence-level
                wordsmithing.</p>
